### [Sample Resume](https://ankitsultana.me/jade-resume/deedy-resume.pdf)

### [Web Link](https://ankitsultana.me/jade-resume)

This is [deedy](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume)'s awesome resume template, but without any **TeX**.

You can use [jade](http://jade-lang.com) to edit the content to your heart's delight. There is an `index.jade` file that is initially filled with deedy's data, so you can compare [this](https://ankitsultana.me/jade-resume/deedy-resume.pdf) and the [original](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume/master/OpenFonts/sample-image.png) one written in Tex.

### Installation

A simple three step installation process:

* Clone this repo (I'd recommend you to fork):

**Note:** Use `--depth 1` to avoid having to download unnecessary commits.

```
git clone https://github.com/bk2dcradle/jade-resume.git --depth 1
```

* Inside the `jade-resume` directory, run:

```
npm install
```

* **(Optional)** Initialize git submodules. These are the fonts [Raleway](https://github.com/softwaymedical/raleway.git) and [Lato](https://github.com/mrkelly/lato.git). Note that these have considerable size (about 16 MB combined):

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Workflow

To fill in your entries, you need to edit `index.jade`. You can check the [sample](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/jade-resume/blob/gh-pages/index.jade) to see how it should be filled.

Just go to the `jade-resume` directory and do:

```
grunt server
```

This will open a new tab/window in your default browser, you can use this to save the resume as PDF or preview changes. To change the contents, edit the `index.jade` file. The corresponding tab/window should live reload on every save action on the `index.jade` file. When are you satisfied with the changes, convert the page to PDF as mentioned below.

You can also use an external JSON file for adding text to the resume. In this case, its './data.json`.

### PDF

To convert the web page to [pdf](http://www.wikihow.com/Save-a-Web-Page-as-a-PDF-in-Google-Chrome), use the old Command + P (Ctrl + P) trick in Chrome. Settings should be as follows:

Attribute | Value
----------|------
Layout    | Portrait
Paper Size| Letter
Margins   | None
Pages     | 1

### Jade format guide

Most of the information regarding formatting of `index.jade` can be inferred by going through the same and checking it against the provided pdf. I will just point out some of the non obvious ones:

* `.left-column` supports three kinds of lists


Type of List                                  | Jade
-----------------------------------------------|---------------
Bulleted with each element on one line         | `ul`
Bulleted with inline elements                  | `ul.inline`
Non Bulleted with each element in one line     | `ul.nostyle`

* `.right-column` supports 1 type of unordered list, and 2 types of ordered list. The unordered one is the one you can see in the right column of the resume. The ordered ones are either of type `[1] [2] ...` or `1. 2. ...`
* `table` can be of any number of columns
* You can load data using a JSON file. In this case, I am loading some of the data from `data.json` for demonstration purposes
* You can use `.clearfix` above any element that becomes inline when it should not
* You can use `.no-overlap` on any element to give it some `margin-bottom`
* There are three variants of `br`, spacing increases from top to bottom:
  * `br`
  * `br.two`
  * `br.three`
